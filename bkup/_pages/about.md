## Who am I ?
<div style="text-align: justify">
	<p>
    Well, if you are here, I presume that you know my name and the basic stuffs. Let me tell you what I do and what my interests are instead. I am an Associate - Systems Reliability Engineer at JP Morgan Chase, Seattle. I am responsible for some of the apps that run within their environment, responsible - meaning that I should ensure their apps are running fine and if they fail, should prevent them from failing again. Prior to this, I was with T-Mobile and Target as a Reliability Engineer, with a very similar JD.

    Ever since I was a teenager, I've always wanted to be an educator
