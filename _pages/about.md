## Who am I ? 
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
	<p>
		Hi, I am Aswinkumar (AK). My interests are cloud, system-reliability and user-experience.  I strongly believe that a day spent without learning is not a day that is well spent. I enjoy stepping out of the normal comfort zone, and I believe that's how one can improve. 

		Right now, I am a Systems Reliability Engineer working for a leading <span style="color: #ea0a8e">Tel-Co</span> (yep,<span style="color: #ea0a8e"> T-Mobile</span>) here in the USA. I ensure that my customers are always able to self-serve without the need to speak with an agent. My goal is to be able to provide <span style="color: #ea0a8e">"The Rock-Star"</span> experience for every caller, every single time. 
		
		Prior to this, I was a Guest Reliability Engineer for the "stocks-rally-like-its-2009" retailer, that is having a <span style="color: #ea0a8e">Tel-Co</span>bull's eye</span> (yep, you guessed it right, it's <span style="color: #ea0a8e">Target!</span>) to become the guest's preferred shopping desitnation. I was holding a variety of positions responsible for different Infrastructure Platforms ranging from Virtualization to VoIP Telephony.
